# Psychologist
Directs the faces expression
Uses the faceView and HappinessViewController from Happiness to 
control the mood the face is in. User has four options, when they
choose an option the face is either happy, sad, somewhat sad, or no 
expression. This happens on an iPad or a iPhone 6+ in a spiltView 
controller. On any other device the face slides on and takes over the 
screen modally. Also added a bar button on the top left where when the 
user pushes it, it comes up with a textView with the array of the history
of the face as integers. The popOver conforms to the size of the data, it will take
over the screen if it has too.
